When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    - when working with other people
    - sharing, reviewing and changing work with other persons (for collaboration)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - to decide when which change is visible
    - may rethink some changes before sharing them with another person
    - Stayed control in monitoring and describing changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - fork only happens on GitHub (online, not on my computer)
    - clone: I can clone another's repository from on online-location or either offline
    - branch: is another path where I make changes if e. g. a new function or 'bigger change' is expected

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    - you can go back to a working point you know
    - you have a status where your collaboration started

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    + Faster implementing changes
    - Write separate messages/e-mails explaining the changes
    - Tracking changes would be more difficult and keeping track

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    - When you are unsure if you want to publish your changes or if it works
    - You can surely separate what you did and separate from collaborators
    - When you change in the master you do not have that pull, push and merge effort
