When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    - when working with other people
    - sharing, reviewing and changing work with other persons (for collaboration)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - to decide when which change is visible
    - may rethink some changes before sharing them with another person
    - Stayed control in monitoring and describing changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - fork only happens on GitHub (online, not on my computer)
    - clone: I can clone another's repository from on online-location or either offline
    - branch: is another path where I make changes if e. g. a new function or 'bigger change' is expected

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    - you can go back to a working point you know
    - you have a status where your collaboration started
